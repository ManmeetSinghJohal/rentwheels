# Overview

We're a stealth startup, secretly working on an engaging project while avoiding public attention to reach the market first. We’re looking for a team of developers that can develop a modern car renting application.

The chosen team of developers has to help develop the application’s frontend and backend. Our team of designers has already created a high-fidelity Figma design. Follow the design and get the final website to look as close to the design as possible.

# Technologies

## Client-side

- React.js / Next.js

## Libraries

- You may use any libraries you might need in your code (Clerk)
- You may also use any UI kit you prefer (Material UI, Tailwind, CSS)

## Server-side

- Option 1) Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB
- Option 2) Next.js Server Actions and API Routes
- Option 3) BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) tool: Supabase, Firebase, etc.

# Functionalities

The application needs to have the following functionalities:

- **Homepage** - Consisting of a banner of highlighted cars to rent, pickup and dropoff pickers, and a list of vehicles available for rent.
- **All Cars Page** - List of vehicles, search, a sidebar with filtering functionality
- **Car Details Page** - Consisting of additional car details, such as images, title, brand, price, and a list of other recommended cars available for rent.
- **Add a Car Page** - Add car details (images, title, brand, price) through a form. After submission, the car should appear on the home page
- **Car Rent Page (optional)** - Clicking on “Rent Now” utilizes Stripe’s payment functionalities and redirects to a Stripe-powered checkout page.
- **User page** - Displays a list of cars rented by the user and cars put for rent by the user.

# Bonus Points

Bonus points for:

- **Payments** - Use Stripe to handle payments
- **Exceptional Design Consistency** - Follow the design 100%
- **Alerts** - Develop modals and alerts to handle errors and notifications.
- **Add Car to Favorite Functionality** - Use local storage to save favorited cars.
- **Clean Code** - We cannot emphasize enough how important this is! Keep the code clean and use as many React best practices as possible.

# Timeframe, Team, and Budget

The MVP needs to be ready in one month, which should be more than enough, considering you’ll work in a team of 2-5 people.

We’ll have weekly reports where you can update us on the process.

Good luck!
